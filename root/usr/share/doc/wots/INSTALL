Welcome to WOTS
===============
WOTS is an easily configurable, flexible and hopefully useful logfile
monitoring tool.  If you know `swatch', it isn't all that different in
concept, except that it does quite a bit more, and will do even more
in the future.

Getting WOTS
============
Well, you already have it , but in case you can't remember some time in
the dim distant future, the locations is:

   http://www.e-dynamics.be/wots

The original version (courtesy of Tony Curtis) could be found at:
    http://www.hpcc.uh.edu/~tonyc/tools/
but that no longer exists.

Building WOTS
=============
Nothing to do.
All of WOTS is in perl (of course :-).  You need perl version 5,
preferably 5.00404 or better.

WOTS uses the modules
    Term::ANSIColor (not required, see file 'wots' itself for this)
and
    Mail::Send (not required, see file 'wots' itself for this)
and (required)
    Getopt::Long
    POSIX
    IO::File
    IO::Socket
    Net::Domain
    Sys::Syslog

You can get them from CPAN (the required modules are standard in perl).

If you want the features they offer (highlighted 'echo' and
'mail', uncomment the relevant 'use' lines in the perl script 'wots').

Good luck,

Installing WOTS
===============
Manual:
Just copy the wots.pl and the wotsrc (config file) to a place of your liking.
For convenience, a init script wots.initd and systemd worts.service is provided.
Change in that file the location of wots and the config file, place it in
/etc/init.d and activate it using chkconfig or something similar.

USING WOTS
==========
See the README file for this.

RUNNING AS WINDOWS SERVICE
==========================
This will be native in wots in the future, but for now: read the TODO file.
