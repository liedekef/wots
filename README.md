# wots
a high-performance perl logfile checker for linux and windows

For windows: the ls.exe file needs to be present and configured in wotsrc.

This repository is created to be used together with togo to build the corresponding rpm (therefore the helper.db file)
Basic documentation and examples can be found in root/usr/share/doc
The main config should go in /etc/wotsrc and extras in /etc/wots.d
